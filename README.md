Ensure you have your training data in the appropriate format.

Update the load_data() function in the autils.py file to load your training data.

Run the main script to construct, train, and test the neural network:

bash
Copy code
python main.py

### Neural Network Architecture

The neural network architecture consists of:

Input Layer: 400 units (flattened 20x20 image)
Hidden Layer 1: 25 units, sigmoid activation
Hidden Layer 2: 15 units, sigmoid activation
Output Layer: 1 unit, sigmoid activation (binary classification)

### Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and the Binary Cross-Entropy loss function.

To train the model, run the script main.py. The training process includes 20 epochs.

### Testing and Prediction
The model's predictions can be tested using specific examples from the training dataset. The script main.py demonstrates how to predict and test two examples.
